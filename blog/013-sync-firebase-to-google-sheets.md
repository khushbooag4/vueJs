In one of my earlier posts I have described how to sync data from [Google sheets to Firebase](https://websiddu.com/blog/sync-google-sheets-to-firebase.html). In some cases it desired the inverse i.e Firebase â†’ Google Sheets. Firebase is extremely powerful and very approachable to do such kinds of manipulations.

In this blog post I will describe how to sync new data written to a Firebase database to a Google Sheet. It includes a method for obtaining, storing, and using Oauth2 tokens for Google API access.

### Step 1: Enable Google Sheets API

Follow step 1 to enable Google Sheets API in your Firebase project: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs

### Step 2:

Create a service account in your project; save the json file in the functions folder with the file name serviceAccount.json.

### Step 3:

Create a spreadsheet in Drive; rename the first worksheet 'Scores'; add Player and Score headers in row 1, columns A and B.

### Step 4:

Share it with edit access to the email address in your service account.

### Step 5:

Copy the spreadsheet id (from its URL) to the spreadsheetId string in the TypeScript source.
