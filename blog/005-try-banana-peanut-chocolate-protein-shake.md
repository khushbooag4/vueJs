I was regular to gym few months ago. So, Usually I use to have a shake after my daily workout with regular breakfast or before going to sleep.

These, protein shakes are great additions to your meal plan. They can even be good meal replacements. Working for both muscle gain and fat loss.

- 2 Scoops Chocolate Whey Protein Powder
- 1.5 Tbsp Cocoa Powder
- 1.5 Tbsp Peanut Butter
- 1 Large Banana
- 500ml Chilled Milk
- 4-6 Ice Cubes (If you boil milk)

The process is simple. Put all the ingredients in a blender and blitz. You can add more ice cubes until you reach a consistency you are happy with. Some prefer the shake smoother, some prefer it thicker. You can add and subtract the quantities to get the desired nutritional profile. Building muscle phase? Add more milk, peanut butter, bananas. Weight loss? Swap water in for milk.
