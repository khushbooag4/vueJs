## San Simeon, CA

We were able to take the Grand rooms tour out of many. It was an 1 hour guided tour by an old enthusiastic lady who chanted <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Morgan' target="_blank">Julia Morgan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst" target="_blank">William Randolph Hearst</a> a gazillion times. When I learnt that William brought polar bears to california for his visitors, I was stunned and wondered what all could a filthy rich person could do.
