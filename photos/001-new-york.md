## New York, New York

This is the first time ever I visiting New York City. The city is very diverse and felt like it has a lot of history. The people here are well dressed and formal. New York has really cheap and tasty street food. Here are some of the great views of the skyscrapers from the 14th floor of Chelsea market.

I didn't manage to click many pictures and also I was quite annoyed as my camera took long time to process long exposure pictures. I should get a better camera ;).
