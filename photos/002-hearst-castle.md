:::story
A friend on mine Ruiyi Zhou took us to this beautify museum located 300 miles away to the south california. This may not be the best museum but I'm really impressed by the various architectural elements in the museum. There was little bus ride to the top of the hill which is nice.

## San Simeon, CA

We were able to take the Grand rooms tour out of many. It was an 1 hour guided tour by an old enthusiastic lady who chanted <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Morgan' target="_blank">Julia Morgan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst" target="_blank">William Randolph Hearst</a> a gazillion times. When I learnt that William brought polar bears to california for his visitors, I was stunned and wondered what all could a filthy rich person could do.
