:::story
Spontaneously my friends and I went to Mount Tamalpais and Point reyes on a 300mile road trip. I thoroughly enjoyed the winding roads and even saw a wild fox for the first time so close.

## Point reyes

Point reyes I can say one of amazing drives ways that I have been. The road leading to point reyes was filled with cow farms, grass lands and super pretty views. And finally the point reyes light house was located a mile from the entrance. All good vibe and nice views.

## Mount Tamalpais

Mount Tamalpais had a beautiful view of the city from the tallest peak. Though we went of a really short hike for 1.3miles it was wroth seeing the whole city from a different perspective.
